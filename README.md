I am a medical research scientist passionate about data particularly in healthcare industry in order to improve health of population.This passion drove me in medical and global health research, which has enabled me to conduct and publish research papers in high impact peer reviewed journals, while working  and gaining mentorship from research organisation such Oxplore, Global health Focus and academic journals. That experience has been an opportunity to develop not only writing and communication skills but also leadership and collaborative abilities. To be more effective in that research endeavour, I was self-directed and motivated to learn new skills such as Statistics & Data Analysis in Public Health and pandemic data science which significantly sharpened my critical thinking regarding healthcare data and gave me an insight on how to use data to improve health systems and influence health policy. 
This experience in research deepened my curiosity to know more about data analysis and I was recently selected against a lot of competions to engage in a 12-week  Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with Just IT training. This training gave me an opportunity to develop new skills necessary for a data analyst and run several data projects using Excel, SQL, Python, R, azure, Tableau and Power BI, which will be posted in my GitHub and Tableau Public portfolios. 
My immediate goal is to become established in a role as a Data Technician or apprentice and work with like-minded individuals from whom I can learn as much as possible.  I am keen to apply mys kills to dentify and unlock hidden insights in data which will be useful for organisationâ€™s objectives that include improving health and excellence.
